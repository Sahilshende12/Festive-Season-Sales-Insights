Festive-Season-Sales-Insights

✅ Objective

The primary goal of this project is to analyze Festivel sales data to uncover customer behavior, product performance, and regional sales patterns. By performing data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA), we aim to extract meaningful insights that can help improve business strategies for future festive campaigns.

🧹 1. Data Cleaning & Preparation

Loaded the Festivel sales dataset and inspected the structure.
Removed unnecessary columns: Status, unnamed1.
Handled missing data by dropping rows with null values to maintain analysis integrity.
Converted the Amount column to integer type for proper numerical analysis.
Final dataset size after cleaning: 1111 rows × 15 columns.

🔍 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Performed a series of visual and statistical analyses using:

Pandas – for data manipulation.
Matplotlib and Seaborn – for data visualization.

We explored patterns across key dimensions:

State-wise and City-wise order distribution
Gender and age-based sales behavior
Profession-wise product interest
Top product categories and items sold
